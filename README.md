# Multipeer-Connectivity-Example
an app to demonstrate Multipeer Connectivity in iOS with Swift and UIKit


Multipeer Connectivity appears to be deprecated. Apple has ackowledged this in various posts on the developer forums but they have not updated their documentation. The best solution to achieve Multipeer Connectivity is with a custom networking implementation and to not use Multipeer Connectivity API at all.
